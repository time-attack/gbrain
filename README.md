# GBrain

**Your AI agent is smart but forgetful. GBrain gives it a brain.**

**[97.60% R@5 on the public LongMemEval `_s` benchmark.](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/master/docs/benchmarks/2026-05-07-longmemeval-s.md)**
500 questions. **No LLM in the retrieval loop. $0.50 per 1000 queries.**
Deterministic, reproducible, ships in the binary as `gbrain eval longmemeval
<dataset.jsonl>`. Beats MemPalace's published raw baseline by a point. Beats
every academic dense retriever on this dataset (Stella ~85%, Contriever ~78%,
BM25 ~70%). Within striking distance of MemPalace's LLM-reranked variant
(98.4% held-out) — but they pay for an LLM call on every retrieval; gbrain
does not. Mastra and Supermemory publish higher numbers but measure a
different metric (end-to-end QA accuracy with an LLM judge, not retrieval
recall).

**Plus +31.4 points P@5 from the self-wiring knowledge graph** when your
queries are relational ("who works at X?", "what did Y invest in this
quarter?"). [BrainBench v0.20.0](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/master/docs/benchmarks/2026-04-23-brainbench-v0.20.0.md)
measures gbrain against three baselines on a 240-page rich-prose corpus with
145 relational gold queries. Vector-only RAG scores **10.8% P@5**. Grep-BM25
scores **17.1%**. Vector+keyword RRF without graph scores **17.8%**. gbrain
scores **49.1%** — the graph layer is separable, measured, and load-bearing.
Flat across seven releases (v0.16 → v0.20). Zero retrieval regression.

Built by the President and CEO of Y Combinator to run his own AI agents. The
production brain powering Garry's OpenClaw and Hermes deployments has grown
into the largest documented personal-AI knowledge graph in active use:

| | |
|---|---|
| **~100K** | total items in the brain |
| **~16,000** | people pages, auto-enriched |
| **~5,000** | companies |
| **~8,000** | concepts |
| **~4,000** | original essays + ideas + drafts |
| **~3,500** | daily notes |
| **~31,000** | media items (tweets, books, papers, interviews, films, articles, calls) |
| **~2,200** | LLM-conversation transcripts (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, agent forks) |
| **108** | cron jobs running autonomously |
| **273** | skills in the live agent fork (35 from gbrain bundle + 238 user-built on top) |

The agent ingests meetings, emails, tweets, voice calls, books, papers, and
original ideas while you sleep. It enriches every person and company it
encounters. It fixes its own citations, consolidates memory overnight,
detects contradictions in your typed claims about people and companies, and
flags trajectory regressions. You wake up and the brain is smarter than when
you went to bed.

GBrain is those patterns, generalized. **Install in 30 minutes. Your agent
does the work.** As Garry's personal agent gets smarter, so does yours.

## Install

### On an agent platform (recommended)

GBrain is designed to be installed and operated by an AI agent. If you don't
have one running yet:

- **[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — deploy [AlphaClaw on Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/chrysb/alphaclaw) (one click, 8GB+ RAM)
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)** — deploy on [Railway](https://github.com/praveen-ks-2001/hermes-agent-template) (one click)

Paste this into your agent:

```
Retrieve and follow the instructions at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garrytan/gbrain/master/INSTALL_FOR_AGENTS.md
```

The agent clones the repo, installs GBrain, sets up the brain, loads 35
skills, and configures recurring jobs. You answer a few questions about
API keys. ~30 minutes.

### Standalone CLI (no agent)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain.git && cd gbrain && bun install && bun link
gbrain init                     # local brain, ready in 2 seconds
gbrain import ~/notes/          # index your markdown
gbrain query "what themes show up across my notes?"
```

`gbrain init` picks a search mode (`conservative` / `balanced` / `tokenmax`).
Cost spread depends on mode × downstream model — see [docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md)
for the full matrix and `gbrain search modes` for what's active.

### MCP server (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf)

```bash
# stdio MCP — local single-user
claude mcp add gbrain "$(which gbrain) serve"

# HTTP MCP — multi-user, OAuth 2.1, admin dashboard
gbrain serve --http                              # prints admin bootstrap token
gbrain serve --http --bind 0.0.0.0 --public-url https://gbrain.example.com
```

The HTTP server supports **OAuth 2.1** (`client_credentials`,
`authorization_code` with PKCE, refresh token rotation, revocation, RFC 7591
DCR behind `--enable-dcr`). Source-scoped clients with `--source dept-x` tie
write authority to one source; `--federated-read S1,S2,S3` adds orthogonal
read scopes. Loopback bind by default — pass `--bind 0.0.0.0` to publish to
the LAN.

## Benchmarks

Every retrieval, ranking, and compression claim in this README is backed by
a published eval. Full reports, reproduction commands, corpora, and
cross-system tables live in the sibling
[gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) repo.

### Public benchmarks

| Benchmark | gbrain result | Top published competitor | Comparable | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LongMemEval `_s` (R@5, 500Q)** | **97.60%** (`gbrain-hybrid`, no LLM in loop) | MemPalace raw 96.6%; hybrid+rerank 98.4% (with LLM) | yes — same dataset, K, n | 2026-05-07 |
| LongMemEval `_s` per-type | +7.1pt single-session-assistant vs MemPal | MemPal | yes | 2026-05-07 |

Mastra (94.87%) and Supermemory (~99%) publish QA-accuracy on this dataset
with an LLM judge in the loop — different metric, not directly comparable.
See the [cross-system comparison](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/master/docs/comparison-systems.md)
for the honest table.

### In-house BrainBench corpus

| Adapter | P@5 | R@5 | Δ vs gbrain |
|---|---|---|---|
| **gbrain** (full hybrid + graph) | **49.1%** | **97.9%** | — |
| vector-grep-rrf-fusion (graph disabled) | 17.8% | 65.1% | **−31.4 pts P@5** |
| grep-only (BM25) | 17.1% | 62.4% | −32.0 pts P@5 |
| vector-only (cosine RAG) | 10.8% | 40.7% | −38.4 pts P@5 |

240-page rich-prose corpus (80 people / 80 companies / 50 meetings / 30
concepts), 145 relational gold queries, deterministic re-runs. The graph
layer's contribution (+31.4 pts P@5) is separable and reproducible. Flat
across v0.16 → v0.20 — zero retrieval regression over seven releases.

### Source-swamp resistance

Curated content vs bulk content: do articles win against chat dumps that
mention the same phrases? gbrain v0.22.0 source-aware ranking lifts top-1
from 80% (grep-only) and 90% (pre-source-boost) to **93.3%**, while
keeping swamp-at-top at **6.7%**. [Full report.](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/master/docs/benchmarks/2026-04-25-brainbench-cat13b-source-swamp.md)

### Skill / prompt compression

`functional-area-resolver` is a two-layer dispatch pattern for compressing
an agent's `AGENTS.md` / `RESOLVER.md`. A real-world 25KB resolver
compressed to **13KB (48% size)** and **gained +13 to +17pp routing
accuracy** across three frontier models (Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5).
The `(dispatcher for: ...)` clause is load-bearing — the ablation case
(same compression without it) collapses Sonnet's lenient accuracy to
41.7%. [Receipts in this repo.](evals/functional-area-resolver/)

### Run your own evals

```bash
# Public benchmark, in-process, ~30s warm
gbrain eval longmemeval ~/Downloads/longmemeval_s.jsonl

# Multi-model output quality gate (3 frontier models score the same output)
gbrain eval cross-modal --task "..." --output report.md

# Capture every real query/search call as eval data (contributor mode)
GBRAIN_CONTRIBUTOR_MODE=1 gbrain eval export > snapshot.ndjson
gbrain eval replay --against snapshot.ndjson   # regression-gate retrieval

# In-house BrainBench (sibling repo)
cd ~/git/gbrain-evals && bun eval/runner/multi-adapter.ts
```

## What it does

### 1. Ingests everything, enriches automatically

Markdown sync from a git brain. Meeting transcripts (Whisper / Groq Whisper).
EPUB / PDF books (`book-mirror` produces personalized chapter-by-chapter
analysis). PDFs of academic papers with citation extraction. Articles via
Reader / Perplexity / archive.is. Tweets (timeline + bookmarks). Voice notes.
ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity / agent-fork conversation exports. Email
threads. Calendar events. Foursquare exports. Slack channel archives.

Every page write extracts entity references → typed links (`attended`,
`works_at`, `invested_in`, `founded`, `advises`, `mentions`) with zero LLM
calls. The graph wires itself.

### 2. Hybrid search that beats vector-only RAG

Per-query: vector + keyword + RRF fusion + multi-query expansion (Haiku) +
source-aware ranking + reranking (ZeroEntropy, optional). Two-stage CTE so
the HNSW index stays usable when source-boost re-ranks the top-K. Hard
exclude prefixes (`test/`, `archive/`, etc.) at retrieval. Intent classifier
auto-selects detail level by query type (entity / temporal / event /
general). **P@5 49.1%, R@5 97.9%** on the BrainBench corpus.

### 3. Self-maintaining via the dream cycle

A 9-phase nightly cycle: `lint → backlinks → sync → synthesize → extract →
patterns → recompute_emotional_weight → embed → orphans` (+ a `purge` phase
for the destructive-guard lifecycle). Each phase is independently runnable
via `gbrain dream --phase <name>`. Subagents fan out under a rate-leased
Anthropic client; protected job names gate trust; per-job + per-cycle
timeouts; auto-replay on stalled jobs. Conversation transcripts become brain
pages with content-hash dedup so re-runs are no-ops.

### 4. Multi-source brains + temporal trajectory

`gbrain sources add <id> --local-path <path>` mounts additional brains
alongside your `host` brain (team-published, CEO-class, departmental). Each
source has its own RLS-isolated DB rows. OAuth clients can write to one
source and read federated.

Author typed claims in the `## Facts` fence: `mrr=50000`, `arr=2000000`,
`team_size=12`, `valuation_usd=15000000`. `gbrain eval trajectory
companies/<slug>` prints the chronological history with regressions
auto-flagged. `gbrain founder scorecard <entity>` rolls up claim accuracy,
consistency, growth direction, and red flags into a stable JSON contract.

### 5. Durable background work

`gbrain agent run <prompt>` submits LLM-loop subagents. `gbrain jobs submit
shell --params '{"cmd":"..."}'` (operator-only) submits shell jobs.
`gbrain jobs supervisor start` runs a self-restarting worker daemon with
crash-cause classification, OOM detection, RSS watchdog, and per-cause
metrics surfaced in `gbrain doctor`. `gbrain autopilot --install` registers
the dream cycle as a launchd / systemd job.

Children + aggregator parents, `child_done` inbox for fan-in, per-job
timeouts, idempotency keys, cascade-kill. Supervisor classifies exit codes
into `runtime_error / oom_or_external_kill / graceful_shutdown / clean_exit`
so `120 crashes/24h` reads correctly instead of false-alarming on clean
worker drains.

---

## Skills

35 curated skills ship in the bundle. The agent installs them via
`gbrain skillpack scaffold <name>` (one-time additive copy — you own the
files after). See [docs/guides/skillpacks-as-scaffolding.md](docs/guides/skillpacks-as-scaffolding.md)
for the model.

- `_brain-filing-rules.md` — file-placement rules (primary subject wins)
- `_output-rules.md` — output quality standards (no LLM slop)
- `_friction-protocol.md` — log user friction to `~/.gstack/friction/`
- `conventions/` — cross-cutting rules (quality, brain-first, model-routing, test-before-bulk, cross-modal)

---

## How it works

### Architecture

Contract-first: `src/core/operations.ts` defines ~47 shared operations. CLI
and MCP server are both generated from that one source. Engine factory
dynamically imports the configured engine (`pglite` for zero-config local,
`postgres` for Supabase / self-hosted).

**Trust boundary:** `OperationContext.remote` distinguishes trusted local
CLI (`remote: false`) from untrusted agent-facing callers (`remote: true`).
Security-sensitive operations tighten when `remote: true` is set.

### Knowledge model

Every brain page is markdown with YAML frontmatter:
- **Frontmatter:** `name`, `type` (person / company / deal / concept / ...),
  `tags`, optional `sources:`, `triggers:` (for skills), `## Facts` fenced
  block with typed claims (`mrr=50000`, `arr=2000000`).
- **Compiled truth:** stable section the agent updates with consensus
  knowledge.
- **Timeline:** append-only event log, sentinel-separated (`<!-- timeline -->`).

Pages are chunked by recursive markdown structure (default) or LLM-guided
(opt-in). 29 programming languages get tree-sitter semantic chunking with
embedded WASM grammars and tiktoken token budgeting.

### Knowledge graph

Every page write fires `extract.ts`:
- Matches `[Name](people/slug)` markdown links AND `[[people/slug|Name]]`
  Obsidian wikilinks.
- Heuristics infer link type: `attended`, `works_at`, `invested_in`,
  `founded`, `advises`, `source`, `mentions`.
- Bulk-insert via `unnest()` arrays — 4-5 params regardless of batch size,
  sidesteps the 65535-param cap.

Query: `gbrain graph-query alice --depth 2 --direction in` returns who
attended what with Alice, transitively.

### Search

Per-query pipeline:
1. Query intent classifier (entity / temporal / event / general) selects
   detail level.
2. Multi-query expansion via Haiku (deterministic, off by default in
   `conservative` mode).
3. Hybrid: keyword (`ts_rank` × source-factor) + vector (HNSW + source-boost
   re-rank) + RRF fusion.
4. Optional reranker (ZeroEntropy `zerank-2` flagship or `zerank-1`).
5. Source-aware ranking: curated content (`originals/`, `concepts/`,
   `writing/`) outranks bulk content (chat transcripts, `daily/`,
   `media/x/`). Hard-exclude `test/`, `archive/`, `attachments/` by default.
6. Dedup + token budget enforcement per mode.

### Engines

- **PGLite** — embedded Postgres 17.5 via WASM. Zero-config default. Single-
  file backup. Forward-reference bootstrap walks schema migrations cleanly
  across the v0.13–v0.35 wave.
- **Postgres + pgvector** — Supabase / self-hosted. `pg_trgm` + HNSW indexes.
  Migrations include 60+ schema bumps with `sqlFor.postgres` / `sqlFor.pglite`
  branches for engine-specific DDL.

`gbrain migrate --to supabase` / `--to pglite` does the round-trip.

### Storage tiering

For brains crossing 100K files where bulk machine-generated content
dominates the size: declare which directories are `db_tracked` (committed)
vs `db_only` (DB-only, gitignored). `gbrain sync` manages `.gitignore`
automatically; `gbrain export --restore-only` repopulates missing DB-only
files from the database.

See [docs/guides/storage-tiering.md](docs/guides/storage-tiering.md) for the
config shape and per-tier defaults.

## Origin story

Garry Tan needed a brain that could remember every meeting, every founder
encounter, every essay he'd ever drafted, every idea he wanted to chase
later. Off-the-shelf knowledge tools (Roam, Obsidian, Notion) handle
storage. None of them ingest a meeting, enrich the attendees, build the
graph, fix the citations, and surface the connection three weeks later
when it matters. So he built one. The first 12 days produced a working
brain. The next 12 months produced 100,000 pages, a self-wiring knowledge
graph, 108 cron jobs, and the multi-engine architecture that ships here.

GBrain is the generalized version of that work. You scaffold the skills.
You bring your data. Your agent runs the patterns. The brain compounds
nightly.
