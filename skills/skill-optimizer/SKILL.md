# Skill Optimizer

Self-evolving skill optimization. Treats SKILL.md as the trainable parameters
of a frozen agent. Validation-gated, budget-capped, atomic-versioned.

Based on SkillOpt (arXiv 2605.23904, Microsoft Research, May 2026).

## When to invoke this skill

The user wants to:
- Improve an existing skill's execution quality against a benchmark
- Bootstrap a benchmark file for a new skill
- Re-tune a skill after switching target models

## Iron Law

- **Validation gating is MANDATORY.** Every candidate must clear median-of-3
  + epsilon=0.05 margin against the sel-set before SKILL.md gets rewritten.
- **Frontmatter mutation is FORBIDDEN.** The optimizer only edits the body.
  Routing surface (`triggers:`, `brain_first:`) stays invariant.
- **Bundled skills require explicit opt-in.** Skills shipping with gbrain
  cannot be auto-mutated; user passes `--allow-mutate-bundled` or
  `--no-mutate` (default for the dream-cycle phase) writes proposed.md
  for review.
- **Bootstrap output requires human review.** `--bootstrap-from-routing`
  writes a sentinel; user must hand-review + delete the sentinel +
  re-run with `--bootstrap-reviewed` before optimization can use it.

## The pipeline

## Decision tree

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| New skill, no benchmark yet | `gbrain skillopt foo --bootstrap-from-routing` → review → `--bootstrap-reviewed` |
| Iterating on an existing skill | `gbrain skillopt foo --benchmark skills/foo/skillopt-benchmark.jsonl` |
| Costly run, want preview | Add `--dry-run` |
| Bundled skill (skills/ in gbrain repo) | Default writes proposed.md; add `--allow-mutate-bundled` to commit |
| Want to review changes before applying | Add `--no-mutate` |
| Mid-run crash | `gbrain skillopt foo --resume <run-id>` |

## Output Format

When invoked, this skill produces:

- Updated `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (when mutation is allowed)
- `skills/<name>/skillopt/best.md` — pointer copy of current best
- `skills/<name>/skillopt/versions/vNNNN_eN_sN.md` — per-step snapshots
- `skills/<name>/skillopt/history.json` — append-only run record
- `skills/<name>/skillopt/rejected.json` — bounded LRU of rejected edits
- `~/.gbrain/audit/skillopt-YYYY-Www.jsonl` — ISO-week-rotated audit trail

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't bypass the validation gate.** The median-of-3 + epsilon=0.05 is
  load-bearing; without it, the optimizer accepts noise as improvement.
- **Don't optimize bundled skills without `--allow-mutate-bundled`.** They
  ship with gbrain and are load-bearing for downstream agents.
- **Don't use `--bootstrap-from-routing` output without review.** The
  optimizer model invents success criteria; a human must sanity-check
  before SkillOpt optimizes against them.

## Contract

`runSkillOpt(opts)` returns:
```
{
  outcome: 'accepted' | 'no_improvement' | 'aborted' | 'errored',
  receipt: { run_id, skill_sha8, benchmark_sha8, models, scores, cost },
  finalText: string,
  mutatedSkillFile: boolean,
  proposedPath?: string
}
```
